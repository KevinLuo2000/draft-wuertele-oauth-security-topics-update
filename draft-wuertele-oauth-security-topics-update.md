# Introduction {#Introduction}

Since the publication of the first OAuth 2.0 Security Best Practices
document {{RFC9700}}, new threats to OAuth 2.0 ecosystems have been
identified. This document therefore serves as an extension of the
original {{RFC9700}} and is to be read in conjunction with it.

Like {{RFC9700}} before, this document provides important security
recommendations and it is RECOMMENDED that implementers upgrade their
implementations and ecosystems as soon as feasible.

## Structure

TODO explain the document structure and how it "fits" with {{RFC9700}}

# Conventions and Terminology

{::boilerplate bcp14-tagged}

This specification uses the terms "access token", "authorization
endpoint", "authorization grant", "authorization server", "client",
"client identifier" (client ID), "protected resource", "refresh
token", "resource owner", "resource server", and "token endpoint"
defined by OAuth 2.0 {{RFC6749}}.
