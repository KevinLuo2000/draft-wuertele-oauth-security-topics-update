--- abstract

This document updates the set of best current security practices for
OAuth 2.0 by extending the security advice given in RFC 6749, RFC
6750, and RFC 9700, to cover new threats that have been discovered
since the former documents have been published.

# Introduction {#Introduction}

Since the publication of the first OAuth 2.0 Security Best Practices
document {{!RFC9700}}, new threats to OAuth 2.0 ecosystems have been
identified. This document therefore serves as an extension of the
original {{!RFC9700}} and is to be read in conjunction with it.

Like {{!RFC9700}} before, this document provides important security
recommendations and it is RECOMMENDED that implementers upgrade their
implementations and ecosystems as soon as feasible.

## Structure

TODO explain the document structure and how it "fits" with {{!RFC9700}}

# Conventions and Terminology

{::boilerplate bcp14-tagged}

This specification uses the terms "access token", "authorization
endpoint", "authorization grant", "authorization server", "client",
"client identifier" (client ID), "protected resource", "refresh
token", "resource owner", "resource server", and "token endpoint"
defined by OAuth 2.0 {{!RFC6749}}.
