--- abstract

This document updates the set of best current security practices for
OAuth 2.0 by extending the security advice given in RFC 6749, RFC
6750, and RFC 9700, to cover new threats that have been discovered
since the former documents have been published.

# Introduction {#Introduction}

Since the publication of the first OAuth 2.0 Security Best Practices
document {{!RFC9700}}, new threats to OAuth 2.0 ecosystems have been
identified. This document therefore serves as an extension of the
original {{!RFC9700}} and is to be read in conjunction with it.

Like {{!RFC9700}} before, this document provides important security
recommendations and it is RECOMMENDED that implementers upgrade their
implementations and ecosystems as soon as feasible.

## Structure

TODO explain the document structure and how it "fits" with {{!RFC9700}}

# Conventions and Terminology

{::boilerplate bcp14-tagged}

This specification uses the terms "access token", "authorization
endpoint", "authorization grant", "authorization server", "client",
"client identifier" (client ID), "protected resource", "refresh
token", "resource owner", "resource server", and "token endpoint"
defined by OAuth 2.0 {{!RFC6749}}.

# Attacks and Mitigations {#AttacksMitigations}

TODO section intro, mention that we do not repeat {{!RFC9700}} stuff
here

## Audience Injection Attacks {#AudienceInjection}

When using signature-based client authentication methods such as
`private_key_jwt` as defined in {{OpenID.Core}} or signed JWTs as
defined in {{?RFC7521}} and {{?RFC7523}}, a malicious authorization
server may be able to obtain and use a client's authentication
credential, enabling them to impersonate a client towards another
honest authorization server.

### Attack Description

The descriptions here follow [TODO paper], where additional details of
the attack are laid out.  Audience injection attacks require a client
to interact with at least two authorization servers, one of which is
malicious, and to authenticate to both with a signature-based
authentication method using the same key pair.  Furthermore, the
client needs to be willing to authenticate at an endpoint other than
the token endpoint at the attacker authorization server.  The
following description uses the pushed authorization request endpoint
defined by {{?RFC9126}}, see below for further variants.

[^1]{: source="Tim W."}

[^1]: Mention OID Federation and FAPI 2.0 here as examples of profiles
    that force clients to do that?

Assume that the authorization servers publish the following URIs for
their authorization, token, and pushed authorization request
endpoints, for example via mechanisms such as authorization server
metadata {{?RFC8414}} or OpenID Discovery {{OpenID.Discovery}}.
However, audience injection attacks are also possible on clients with
manually configured authorization server metadata.

Excerpt from H-AS' metadata:

~~~ javascript
"issuer": "https://honest.com",
"authorization_endpoint": "https://honest.com/authorize",
"token_endpoint": "https://honest.com/token",
"pushed_authorization_request_endpoint": "https://honest.com/par",
...
~~~

Excerpt from A-AS' metadata:

~~~ javascript
"issuer": "https://attacker.com",
"authorization_endpoint": "https://attacker.com/authorize",
"token_endpoint": "https://honest.com/token",
"pushed_authorization_request_endpoint": "https://attacker.com/par",
...
~~~

I.e., the attacker authorization server claims to use the honest
authorization server's token endpoint.  The attack now commences as
follows:

1. Client registers at H-AS, and gets assigned a client ID `cid`.
2. Client registers at A-AS, and gets assigned the same client ID
   `cid`. Note that the client ID is not a secret and often send
   through the front channel.
3. Client starts an authorization code grant, e.g., triggered by the
   attacker as a user of the client, with A-AS by sending a pushed
   authorization request to A-AS' pushed authorization request
   endpoint.

One of the parameters of that pushed authorization request is a
`client_assertion` that authenticates the client.

TODO show and explain the contents of the client assertion

TODO explain how the attacker can now use the assertion to break authZ
